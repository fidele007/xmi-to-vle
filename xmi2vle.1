.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xmi2vle
[\fISOURCE_FILE\fR] [\fIDESTINATION_FILE\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B xmi2vle 
reads an input XMI file of a sequence diagram, translate them into another XMI format called VPZ and generate initial CPP files to be used in VLE project. As such, the XMI must be that of a sequence diagram. The preferred UML tool is 
.B Modelio 
which is free and open-source (\fIhttps://www.modelio.org\fR). For best compatibility, use Modelio to export UML diagrams into an XMI file following 
.B OMG UML2.4.1 
standards (please refrain from using EMF UML3.0.0 which is Eclipse Modeling Framework).

In Modelio, refer to the following rules when creating a sequence diagram:

.RS
.IP \[bu] 2
Model names should be under the form MODEL_TYPE:MODEL_NAME. For example, Atomic:MODEL_NAME or Coupled:MODEL_NAME    
.IP \[bu] 
Task name should be a Note in which the message is under the form TASK_NAME/time=TASK_TIME. For example, Execute/time=12.
